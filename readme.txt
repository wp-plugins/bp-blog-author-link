This plugin changes the blog author links on a buddypress site to link to the author's buddypress member profile.

== Description ==

The WP/WPMU author link from the `the_author_posts_link()` template tag on the blog will link to the author's buddypress member profile instead of the author's posts page. 

This plugin will only affect blogs where buddypress is activated sitewide. It will function the same in either the mu-plugins folder or in the plugins folder and activated sitewide.
